## A body reference map of immune cell composition and communication tracks inflammation and plasticity loss through ageing

### Abstract
Characterising the immune system in health and disease across traits like ageing, sex, and ethnicity is one of the pillars of personalised medicine. To identify markers of disease, we need a comprehensive physiological tissue-specific reference. The Human Cell Atlas and other large-scale single-cell sequencing initiatives enable for the first time to build that reference. This study presents a body map of composition and communication for a healthy immune system. We model this map across human developmental stages and demographics, including 29 million cells from 2744 samples across 30 tissues. Our analysis reveals patterns of progressive tissue-specific inflammation and loss of plasticity through ageing and provides a healthy reference body map of immune system composition. To enable this and future atlas-level analyses, we harmonised and curated the CELLxGENE human cell atlas and shared it with the scientific community through the CuratedAtlasQuery API. To enable an atlas-level compositional analysis of single-cell data, we developed sccompMultilevel, a statistical for multilevel analyses of single-cell data. The findings, the data and the tools this study provides will enable a deeper understanding of how the immune system responds to disease through ageing and across demographic groups.
